# Tree Cover & Surface Temperature Regression Analysis

Communities of color and low-income households have been bearing severe consequences due to such historical practice, particularly the alarming heat-related public health (Li et al., 2022). Thus, it is worth studying the relationship between the land surface temperature and the percentage of tree cover in D regions to inform policymakers and non-profit organizations about the most vulnerable regions to target. This report applies regression and statistical significance methods to evaluate the relationship.
